    <p>HAVING conquered Delhi and Punjab, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) saw Haryana – sandwiched between the two – as its
        natural destination. However, in another sign that things have not gone as per the ambitious plans of the party,
        it
        announced Wednesday that it was dissolving its entire state unit.
    </p>

    <!-- <br> -->

    <p> comes less than a year after the AAP undertook a similar exercise in Haryana in March 2022, after which it
        divided its state unit into four zones. Since then, its prospects have not improved much. While it finished
        second
        in the civic polls held in November 2022, where the Congress and Jannayak Janata Party did not contest on party
        symbols, it lost its security deposit in the high-profile Adampur bypoll, finishing even behind the INLD to its
        disappointment.
