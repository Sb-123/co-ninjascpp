            <p style="color:blue;">
                Commenting is one such paractice that is often ignored by programmers,
                especially for codes that are written by multiple
                programmers. But remember, commenting is an improtant part of
                project you creat. With proper comments and organised files
                its always easier for you or others to jump in and understand where things
                are at and how they work.

            </p>
            <li>Invest In Productive Tools</li>
            <p style="color:blue;">
                The Internet is teeming with a host of web development tools,
                from browser add-ons to amart plugins, the amount of choices available
                now is massive! So, why not invest in some really Productive
                web tools that’ll help you improve your front-end designingskills? Tools
                like sublime Text, jQuery, Emmet, Bootstrap, and Sass
                are nothing short of a godsend for web developers.
            </p>
            <li>Always Be Curious.</li>
            <p style="color:blue;">
                A front-end developer has to keep himself/herself updated
                continuously with the latest news and innovations in the field.
                You need to take a proactive atand and learn new things about fornt-end
                development from informative blogs and videos.
                Following are some of the most informative and useful learning
                for font-end developers.
            </p>
            <ul style="color:blue;">
                <li>forntend Focus</li>
                <li>CSS weekly</li>
                <li>JavaScript Weekly</li>
                <li>Web Design Weekly</li>
                <li>codrops</li>
                <li>ShopTalk Podcast</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <li>Refactor Your code form time to time</li>
            <p style="color:blue;">
                By "refactoring" your code, you're only enhancing the code without
                tempering with its functionlity. This will improve the
                quality and readability quotient of your code and the more often you do it,
                your code will continually be updated into a cleaner
                and freasher version of advantages that refactoring offers is that it ensures your
                code remains free frokm plagiarism.
            </p>
            <li>version control</li>
            <p style="color:blue;">
                As a developer, version control is something that you must know about. Version control systems let you
                keep track of changes made to the code over time. And not just this, they also make it easy to revert
                back to an earlier version if you screw something up. Thus using verion control will save you some
                sleepless nights for sure. One of the most widely used version control systems is Git. Thus knowing git
                has been a requirement for almost every development job these days.

        signature style.
