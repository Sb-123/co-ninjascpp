            Commenting is one such paractice that is often ignored
            by programmers, especially for codes taht written
            by multiple programmers. But remember, commenting
            is an improtant part of project you create. With proper
            commenting and organised files its always easier for you or others to jump in and understand where things
            are at and
            how they work.
